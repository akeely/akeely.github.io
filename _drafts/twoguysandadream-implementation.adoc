== Implementation

Now that all of the acceptance tests are in place, I started the actual implementation. As I mentioned in a link:{% post_url 2015-02-21-twoguysandadream-refactoring-domain-model %}[previous post], I followed the link:http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html[Clean Architecture] to design my components.

For this design, I added a `LeagueRepository` interface to the domain to retrieve a `League`. I then needed three components on my adapter layer to complete the implementation, a `dal` for retrieving information from the database, and `resources`/`api` layer to expose REST endpoints to access the data from the web application, and an application layer to wire everything together.

To manage all of these layers, I chose link:http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] as a microservice framework that allowed me to quickly create these implementations.

== Data Access

For the `dal` layer, I used link:https://spring.io/guides/gs/relational-data-access/[Spring JDBC] to manage database connections. For new projects, link:http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[Spring Data JPA] would get me up and running faster, but writing custom SQL was easier to integrate with the legacy database.

== Application Layer


== Performance Testing
