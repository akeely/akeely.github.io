The UML above is generated at link:http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw[] using the following syntax.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[League|id:long;name:String;rosterSize:int;budget:BigDecimal;minimumBid:BigDecimal|getRosters();getTeamStatistics();]-[note:Aggregate root{bg:wheat}]
[League]<>-auctionBoard*>[Bid|amount:BigDecimal;expirationTime:long]
[League]<>-teams*>[Team|id:long;name:String;budgetAdjustment:BigDecimal;adds:int]
[Team]<>-roster*>[Player]
[Bid]<>->[Player]
[Bid]<>->[Team]

== Data Access


== Web API


== Performance Testing
